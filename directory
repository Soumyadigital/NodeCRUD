                                         READ THE DIRECTORY CAREFULLY
                                         

The server file of our project is 'app.js'
The database created in mongodb to save the register acccount data is 'logindb'
The main collection name of the database is registeruser
We're using cookie , named 'jwt' to make auto login from same browser
We hashed the password entered by the user , but we didn't hashed RepeatPassword to see the registered password for demo
(if developers want to remove this they can remove RepeatPassword)

Firstly go to app .js and paste your <email id> instead of <digitaldeveloper1234@gmail.com> in every place and give the pass of your email id

This Project has APIs for--------

i)Register acccount
ii)Login to acccount(user have to verify email to login)
iii)Logout from acccount
iv)Reset password(user will receive a Reset password link on mail)


We're using get and post for each feature-----

i)Register acccount :  
                    "/"(get)
                    "/register"(post)
ii)Login to acccount:
                    "/login"(get and post)
iii)Logout from acccount:
                    "/logout"(get)
iv)Reset password:
                    "/forgotpassword"(get and post)
                    "/resetpassword/:id/:token"(get and post)


Read the "//comment line on the appp.js " to detect the sender address setting to send email
